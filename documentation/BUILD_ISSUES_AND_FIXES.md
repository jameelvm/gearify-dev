# Build Issues and Fixes

## Summary

The solution had **missing `using` directives** in many generated files. **All issues have been resolved!** ✅

## What Was Missing

The generated service files were missing these common namespaces:

### Required for all files:
- `using System;` - For Guid, DateTime, Exception
- `using System.Collections.Generic;` - For List<>, Dictionary<>
- `using System.Linq;` - For LINQ methods
- `using System.Threading;` - For CancellationToken
- `using System.Threading.Tasks;` - For Task, Task<T>

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Using Statements ✅
**Services affected:** Order, Search, Notification, Cart, Payment

**Fix:** Added all required System namespaces to:
- Domain entities (Guid, DateTime, Collections)
- Application command handlers (Task, Threading, CancellationToken)
- Infrastructure repositories (Task, HttpClient, Configuration)
- Payment providers (HttpClient, Configuration, Logging)

### 2. Cart Controller Signature Mismatch ✅
**Issue:** Cart controller was missing parameters when calling `AddToCartCommand`

**Fix:** Updated `CartController.cs:17` to include all required parameters:
- Added `TenantId` from header (`X-Tenant-Id`)
- Added `ProductName`, `Sku`, and `ImageUrl` to request body
- Updated `AddItemRequest` record to include these fields

### 3. Catalog Service Test Files Included in Main Build ✅
**Issue:** Test files in `Tests/` folder were being compiled with main service, causing missing test framework references

**Fix:** Added exclusion in `Gearify.CatalogService.csproj`:
```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <Compile Remove="Tests/**/*.cs" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Final Status

✅ **All Services Building Successfully:**
- API Gateway
- Catalog Service
- Cart Service
- Payment Service
- Order Service
- Search Service
- Notification Service
- Inventory Service
- Shipping Service
- Tenant Service
- Media Service
- Shared Kernel

## Build Command

To rebuild the entire solution:

```bash
dotnet clean Gearify.sln
dotnet build Gearify.sln
```

**Note:** You may see warnings about OpenTelemetry package vulnerabilities (NU1902). These are moderate severity and can be addressed by upgrading to version 1.8.0+ when ready.

## Code Quality Improvements

### CQRS File Structure Refactoring ✅

**Issue:** Commands and handlers were mixed in the same file, violating Single Responsibility Principle

**Services Refactored:**
- **Cart Service**: Separated `AddToCartCommand`, `RemoveFromCartCommand`, and `ClearCartCommand` into individual files with their handlers
- **Order Service**: Created `CreateOrderCommandHandler.cs`
- **Search Service**: Created `SearchProductsQueryHandler.cs`

**Benefits:**
- Clearer file organization following CQRS best practices
- Each file has a single responsibility
- Easier to navigate, test, and maintain
- Better git diff readability
