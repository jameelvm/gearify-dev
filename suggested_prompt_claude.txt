 Based on your Gearify architecture, here's a comprehensive step-by-step implementation plan to build the complete application:

  Phase-Based Implementation Strategy

  Phase 1: Infrastructure & Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

  1. Setup Polyrepo Structure
  - Create separate repositories for each microservice:
    - gearify-catalog-service
    - gearify-order-service
    - gearify-payment-service
    - gearify-tenant-service
    - gearify-notification-service
    - gearify-shipping-service
    - gearify-api-gateway
    - gearify-frontend
    - gearify-infrastructure (Terraform modules)
    - gearify-gitops (Argo CD configs + Helm charts)

  2. Infrastructure as Code
  - Create Terraform modules in gearify-infrastructure:
    - VPC, subnets, security groups
    - EKS cluster configuration
    - DynamoDB tables (Products, Orders, Tenants, FeatureFlags)
    - PostgreSQL RDS (Payments ledger)
    - ElastiCache Redis cluster
    - SQS queues + SNS topics
    - Cognito user pools
    - S3 buckets (product images, assets)
    - CloudFront distribution

  3. CI/CD Pipeline Setup
  - Configure GitHub Actions for each service:
    - Build Docker images
    - Run unit tests
    - Security scanning (Trivy, SonarQube)
    - Push to ECR
    - Update Helm values
  - Setup Argo CD for GitOps deployment

  Phase 2: Backend Core Services (Weeks 3-6)

  4. Tenant Service (Start Here)
  Why first? All other services need tenant context
  - Features:
    - Tenant registration/onboarding
    - Theme configuration (logo, colors)
    - Feature flag management per tenant
    - Tenant resolution middleware (JWT claims)
  - Database: DynamoDB table with GSI on domain/subdomain
  - Clean Architecture layers: Domain → Application → Infrastructure → API

  5. Catalog Service
  - Product CRUD (bats, pads, gloves, balls)
  - Product attributes: weight, grade, weightType
  - Add-ons management (Knocking, Oiling, Toe Binding)
  - Simple search (DynamoDB query/scan initially)
  - Cache layer with Redis
  - Events: ProductCreated, ProductUpdated, InventoryChanged

  6. Order Service
  - Shopping cart management (Redis-backed)
  - Order creation, status tracking
  - Order history
  - Multi-tenant order isolation
  - Events: OrderCreated, OrderConfirmed, OrderShipped

  7. Payment Service
  - Stripe integration
  - PayPal integration
  - Payment intent creation
  - Webhook handlers for both providers
  - Reconciliation ledger (PostgreSQL)
  - Events: PaymentInitiated, PaymentSucceeded, PaymentFailed

  8. Shipping Service
  - Worldwide shipping rates calculation
  - Integration with carriers (DHL, FedEx, etc.)
  - Tracking number management
  - Events: ShipmentCreated, ShipmentDispatched

  9. Notification Service
  - Email notifications (order confirmations, shipping updates)
  - SQS consumer for all domain events
  - Template management per tenant
  - Integration with AWS SES

  10. API Gateway
  - Ocelot or YARP for .NET
  - Route aggregation
  - JWT validation
  - Rate limiting per tenant
  - Request/response logging

  Phase 3: Frontend Application (Weeks 7-9)

  11. Angular 18 Frontend with SSR
  Structure:
  gearify-frontend/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── app/
  │   │   ├── shells/
  │   │   │   ├── mobile-shell/
  │   │   │   └── desktop-shell/
  │   │   ├── features/
  │   │   │   ├── catalog/
  │   │   │   ├── cart/
  │   │   │   ├── checkout/
  │   │   │   └── orders/
  │   │   ├── core/
  │   │   │   ├── services/
  │   │   │   ├── guards/
  │   │   │   └── interceptors/
  │   │   └── shared/
  │   └── server.ts (SSR entry)

  - Features to implement:
    - Product listing with filters
    - Product detail pages
    - Shopping cart
    - Checkout flow (Stripe/PayPal)
    - Order tracking
    - Multi-tenant theming (dynamic CSS injection)
    - Responsive shells (Mobile/Desktop)

  12. SSR Configuration
  - Angular Universal setup
  - State transfer for API calls
  - SEO optimization (meta tags, structured data)
  - Cache strategy for rendered pages

  ---
  Phase 4: Cross-Cutting Concerns (Weeks 10-11)

  13. Observability
  - Serilog structured logging in all services
  - OpenTelemetry tracing (distributed tracing across services)
  - Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards
  - CloudWatch logs aggregation

  14. Security Hardening
  - JWT validation in all services
  - API key management for service-to-service calls
  - Secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager)
  - CORS configuration
  - Input validation + rate limiting

  15. Caching Strategy
  - Redis for:
    - Product catalog cache
    - Shopping cart sessions
    - Tenant configuration cache
    - Feature flags cache
  - Cache invalidation patterns

  ---
  Phase 5: Testing & Quality (Week 12)

  16. Automated Testing
  - Unit tests (xUnit) - 80%+ coverage
  - Integration tests (Testcontainers for DynamoDB/Postgres/Redis)
  - E2E tests (Playwright for frontend)
  - Load testing (k6 or Gatling)

  17. Documentation
  - OpenAPI/Swagger for all services
  - Architecture decision records (ADRs)
  - Runbooks for operations
  - Developer onboarding guide

  ---
  Phase 6: Deployment & Go-Live (Week 13-14)

  18. Staging Environment
  - Deploy to staging EKS cluster
  - Run smoke tests
  - Performance testing
  - Security audit

  19. Production Deployment
  - Blue-green deployment via Argo CD
  - Database migrations
  - Monitor metrics and logs
  - Gradual rollout (canary)

  ---
  Key Implementation Principles

  1. Service Development Order: Tenant → Catalog → Order → Payment → Shipping → Notification
  2. Database Per Service: Each service owns its data
  3. Event-Driven Communication: Use SNS/SQS for async workflows
  4. Feature Flags: Toggle features per tenant without redeployment
  5. Clean Architecture: Domain logic isolated from infrastructure
  6. CQRS: Separate read/write models where needed (Order/Catalog services)

  Recommended Tech Stack Per Service

  | Service      | Framework      | Database   | Cache | Queue   |
  |--------------|----------------|------------|-------|---------|
  | Catalog      | .NET 8 Web API | DynamoDB   | Redis | SNS     |
  | Order        | .NET 8 Web API | DynamoDB   | Redis | SQS/SNS |
  | Payment      | .NET 8 Web API | PostgreSQL | Redis | SQS/SNS |
  | Tenant       | .NET 8 Web API | DynamoDB   | Redis | -       |
  | Shipping     | .NET 8 Web API | DynamoDB   | -     | SQS/SNS |
  | Notification | .NET 8 Worker  | -          | -     | SQS     |

  Would you like me to:
  1. Start building Phase 1 (Infrastructure setup with Terraform)?
  2. Generate detailed folder structure for a specific service (e.g., Catalog Service with Clean Architecture)?
  3. Create a Mermaid diagram showing service interactions and data flow?
  4. Begin with the Tenant Service implementation (the foundation service)?

  Let me know which phase or component you'd like to start with!
